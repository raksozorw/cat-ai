### Overview

I've trained a model to differentiate between my two cats.

The model can be run on images uploaded via an API. In a separate repo, I have a React frontend to send these images multiple ways.

### Challenges

- first time training any kind of model myself
- not enough data initially
- learning how to use the model with an API
